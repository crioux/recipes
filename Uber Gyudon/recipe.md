#   Uber Gyudon [Spicy Beef Bowl]
	
### Ingredients

	3 cups hot cooked sushi rice
	6-8 oz. beef sliced paper-thin
	1 medium onion
	2 Tbsp vegetable oil
	1 Tbsp hot szechuan fry oil

	1/2 cup beef stock
	1/2 cup soy sauce
	1/4 cup mirin
	1 Tbsp brown sugar
	1/2 tsp dashi mix

	1 Tbsp light corn syrup
	1/4 tsp fresh ginger juice
	2 tsp sriracha hot sauce
	1 chopped scallion
	1 tsp pickled ginger

### Preparation

1. Boil the sushi rice as usual.
2. Cut the beef slices into 2-3 in lengths. 
3. Slice the onion into thin strips (once in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise thinly. Seperate)
4. Make a sauce of the soy sauce, mirin, dashi mix, and brown sugar. Heat just enough to dissolve sugar. Cool.
5. Immerse the beef in the sauce, kneading the beef in the sauce for a few seconds as it marinates.
6. Chop scallion into small (2mm) bits.

### Cooking

1. Heat the vegetable oil and szechuan fry oil in a frying pan or wok. 
2. Add sriracha hot sauce for spiciness if desired
3. Stirfry the onion for a few minutes until soft.
4. Pull the beef out of the sauce and add to frying pan. 
5. Cook, stirring, until the meat is no longer red. 
6. Add corn syrup and stir well, glazing the beef.
8. Add the rest of the sauce to the frying pan and stir fry on -high- for about 8 minutes or so, until much of the sauce is evaporated, leaving the beef dark and the sauce thick. This produces a sukiyaki sauce reduction glaze as well as a sauce.
9. Remove from heat and stir in the ginger juice.

### Serving

1. Put portions of rice in individual bowls.
2. Cover the rice with stir fried beef and onion. 
3. Sprinkle with scallions and garnish with pickled ginger.
4. Cover and serve immediately. Good with green tea and miso soup.
